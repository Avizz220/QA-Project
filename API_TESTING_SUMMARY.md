# API Testing Summary

## API Test Implementation

This document summarizes the API testing approach used for the Task Manager application. The API tests validate the REST endpoints for authentication and task management functionality.

## Testing Tools

Two complementary tools were used for API testing:

1. **Bruno API Client**
   - A lightweight API testing tool with a developer-friendly interface
   - Tests are stored as `.bru` files in a version-control friendly format
   - Supports environment variables and test assertions

2. **Postman**
   - Industry-standard API testing tool
   - Rich testing capabilities with JavaScript test scripts
   - Comprehensive response validation

## Test Organization

The API tests are organized into logical groups:

### Authentication Tests
- User Registration
  - Validates successful user creation
  - Verifies proper error handling for duplicate users
  - Tests field validation (required fields, format validation)

- User Login
  - Validates successful authentication
  - Verifies JWT token generation
  - Tests error handling for invalid credentials

### Task Management Tests
- Create Task
  - Validates successful task creation
  - Tests required fields validation
  - Verifies security (authentication required)

- Get All Tasks
  - Validates retrieval of user-specific tasks
  - Tests pagination and sorting (when applicable)
  - Verifies security (authentication required)

- Get Task by ID
  - Validates retrieval of specific task
  - Tests error handling for non-existent tasks
  - Verifies security (authentication required)

- Update Task Status
  - Validates status updates
  - Tests validation of valid status values
  - Verifies security (authentication required)

- Delete Task
  - Validates successful task deletion
  - Tests error handling for non-existent tasks
  - Verifies security (authentication required)

## Test Validation Approach

Each API test validates multiple aspects:

1. **Status Code Validation**
   - Verifies correct HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 404)

2. **Response Body Validation**
   - Validates structure and content of JSON responses
   - Verifies required fields are present
   - Checks data types and formats

3. **Error Handling Validation**
   - Tests error responses for invalid inputs
   - Verifies clear error messages
   - Tests authentication failures

4. **Functional Validation**
   - Validates business rules are enforced
   - Tests data persistence between requests
   - Verifies state changes (e.g., task status updates)

## Test Data Management

The API tests use a strategic approach to test data:

1. **Self-contained testing**
   - Tests create necessary data (users, tasks) as part of test flow
   - Clean up data after tests when possible

2. **Dynamic data**
   - Uses environment variables to pass data between requests
   - Store tokens, IDs for use in subsequent tests

## Benefits of Dual Tool Approach

Using both Bruno and Postman provides several advantages:

1. **Complementary capabilities**
   - Bruno offers simplified, developer-friendly testing
   - Postman provides advanced scripting and workflow options

2. **Different perspectives**
   - Ensures API works across different client implementations
   - Validates different authentication and request handling approaches

3. **Flexibility**
   - Allows choosing the right tool for specific testing needs
   - Supports different team preferences and workflows
